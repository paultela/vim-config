# Vim Config

Vim config optimized for PHP and web development, with some other things added.

## Install

Clone the repo somewhere, then `cd` into it and run `install.sh`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paultela/vim-config.git
cd vim-config
./install.sh
```

## Credits

I used to use neo/vim-config, but tweaked for PHP development since that's
where I spend the majority of my time. Thus, that config served as a starting
point for this one.
